# engine-cycle
This is a student project to calculate the thermodynamic cycle of a an aircraft engine. Additionally, preliminary designs for compressor/turbine blades can be obtained. Work in Progress.

All you need to get this project running is Python, PyQt5, SciPy and matplotlib. First, download and install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/. Open a terminal and open the directory where the engine-cycle source code lies. Type:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the aforementioned packages and depencies in one go.
If you want to manually install the packages, you can just install the four packages mentioned above with
```
pip install -package-
```
This will also provide the needed dependencies.
Now all you need to do is double click "main.py" and the main window should open. Alternatively, you can open "main.py" inside your IDE and hit run.
